The main reason that I haven't written a blog post in nearly two years is that I got so used to composing tutorial READMEs hosted on GitHub that, for all its merits, I just couldn't bring myself to write code snippets on Medium any longer. Thanks to GitHub Pages and Jekyll though, I have finally managed to stumble through a pretty basic setup here that looks like it'll be easy to self-publish through.

That being said, please be gracious about the layout and styling. I'm not a web developer and I'm not yet proficient with CSS and HTML, so it's not going to be anything fancy.

If you're interested in reading my earlier blog posts from 2015, you can find them on [Medium](https://www.medium.com/@markedwardmurray).

Cheers!
